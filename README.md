# UK VMUG 2018
Repo for UK VMUG presentation and demo at the National Space Center.

Didn't end up using the Terraform as didn't have time to refactor it to AWS after discovering my permissions were goosed in the Rubrik SE lab..

Ansible & Python all good. Probably don't run this in production as my code is shitty, and this is not supported or endorsed by Rubrik, and not supported by me ;)
